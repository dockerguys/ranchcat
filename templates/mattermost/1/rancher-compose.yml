        To store the application data in volume(s), enter the base volume name that should be used. One or more volumes will be created with this value as the prefix. 
        By default, all volumes created will be host scoped named. See "Storage Driver" for other storage options.

      description: |
        To use a stack scoped volume backed by a persistent storage service, enter the name
        of an existing storage driver (e.g. "rancher-nfs"). This also requires "Volume Name" to be set.

        Specify a NFS hostname instead of the default NFS server. Only fill in this option if "Volume Storage Driver" is 
        set to "rancher-nfs", and the volume does not already exist.

      label: "NFS Driver Volume Path"
      description: |
        Specify the exported base path on the NFS server (e.g. "/storage/nfsvol"). The full directory(ies) created 
        on the NFS server will be this path and the volume name(s). Do not append the "/" at the end. This exported base path 
        must already exist on the NFS server. Only fill in this option if "Volume Storage Driver" is set to "rancher-nfs", and 
        the volume does not already exist.

        Maxiumum kernel memory that each container can use (in megabytes). Defaults to unlimited. If this value is lower than Limit Memory, 
        the container will experience OOM error if it runs out of kernel memory, unless memory is unlimited, in which case it will wait 
        for memory released.
