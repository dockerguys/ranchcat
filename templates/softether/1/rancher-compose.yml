        To store the application data in a volume, enter the volume name that should be used.
        By default this will be a (host scoped) named Docker volume. Set "Storage Driver" other storage options.

      description: |
        To use a stack scoped volume backed by a persistent storage service, enter the name
        of an existing storage driver (e.g. rancher-nfs). This also requires "Volume Name" to be set.

      description: |
        Specify the path on the NFS server that will be mounted (e.g. "/storage/nfsvol"). The full directory created 
        on the NFS server will be this path and the volume name. Do not append the "/" at the end. The full path must 
        already exist on the NFS server. Only use this option if "Volume Storage Driver" is set to "rancher-nfs".

        Maxiumum kernel memory that each container can use (in megabytes). Defaults to unlimited. If this value is lower than Limit Memory, 
        the container will experience OOM error if it runs out of kernel memory, unless memory is unlimited, in which case it will wait 
        for memory released.

      label: "Limit Swap Memory"
      description: |
        Maxiumum swap that each container can use (in megabytes). Defaults to twice of memory limit. Set to -1 to allow unlimited, 
        or the same value as Limit Memory to disable swap.
