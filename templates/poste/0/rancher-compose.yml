      description: |
        To use a stack scoped volume backed by a persistent storage service, enter the name
        of an existing storage driver (e.g. rancher-nfs). This also requires "Volume Name" to be set.

        on the NFS server will be this path and the volume name. Do not append the "/" at the end. The full path must 
        already exist on the NFS server. Only use this option if "Volume Storage Driver" is set to "rancher-nfs".
